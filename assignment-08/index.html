    <h1>Site Sketch</h1>
    <p>I decided to have a fixed menu on the side of the page that includes a dropdown for other pages and links. I decided<br>
       to add a little interactivity with the main image on the menu by having a border appear when one hovers over it. In the<br>
        main part of the page I plan to have alot of images which will be inline with each other.</p>
    <img src="images/SiteDesign.jpg" height="200" width="400"/>
