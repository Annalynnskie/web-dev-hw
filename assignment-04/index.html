  <h1>Lyrics</h1>
  <p>
    It doesn't hurt me<br>
(ye-yeah, yeah, yo)<br>
Do you want to feel how it feels?<br>
(Ye-yeah, yeah, yo)<br>
Do you want to know, know that it doesn't hurt me?<br>
(Ye-yeah, yeah, yo)<br>
Do you want to hear about the deal that I'm making?<br>
(Ye-yeah, yeah, yo)<br>
<br>
You<br>
It's you and me<br>
<br>
And if I only could<br>
I'd make a deal with God<br>
And I'd get him to swap our places<br>
Be running up that road<br>
Be running up that hill<br>
Be running up that building<br>
Say, if I only could, oh<br>
<br>
You don't wanna hurt me<br>
(Ye-yeah, yeah, yo)<br>
But see how deep the bullet lies<br>
(Ye-yeah, yeah, yo)<br>
Unaware, I'm tearing you asunder<br>
(Ye-yeah, yeah, yo)<br>
Oh, there is thunder in our hearts<br>
(Ye-yeah, yeah, yo)<br>
Is there so much hate for the ones we love?<br>
(Ye-yeah, yeah, yo)<br>
Oh, tell me, we both matter, don't we?<br>
(Ye-yeah, yeah, yo)<br>
<br>
You<br>
It's you and me<br>
It's you and me, won't be unhappy<br>
<br>
And if I only could<br>
I'd make a deal with God<br>
And I'd get him to swap our places<br>
Be running up that road<br>
Be running up that hill<br>
Be running up that building (Ye-yo)<br>
Say, if I only could, oh<br>
<br>
You (Ye-yeah, yeah, yo)<br>
It's you and me<br>
It's you and me, won't be unhappy<br>
(Ye-yeah, yeah, yo)<br>
<br>
Oh, come on, baby (Ye-yeah)<br>
Oh, come on, darling (Ye-yo)<br>
Let me steal this moment from you now<br>
Oh, come on, angel (Yeah)<br>
Come on, come on, darling<br>
Let's exchange the experience<br>
(Ye-oh, ooh, ooh)<br>
<br>
And if I only could<br>
I'd make a deal with God<br>
And I'd get him to swap our places<br>
I'd be running up that road<br>
Be running up that hill<br>
With no problems<br>
Say, if I only could<br>
I'd make a deal with God<br>
And I'd get him to swap our places<br>
I'd be running up that road<br>
Be running up that hill<br>
With no problems<br>
Say, if I only could<br>
I'd make a deal with God<br>
And I'd get him to swap our places<br>
I'd be running up that road<br>
Be running up that hill<br>
With no problems<br>
<br>
Say, if I only could<br>
Be running up that hill<br>
With no problems<br>
If I only could, be running up that hill<br>
If I only could, be running up that hill<br>
